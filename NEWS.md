# Version 1.0.10

- scaleM() and mscale() are now different functions. mscale() is no longer exported.
- The argument "tuning.chi" of scaleM() has been removed, and it is now computed internally to obtain a consistent scale estimator for the chosen combination of "family" and "delta". 

# Version 1.0.9

- The robustarima Package Status: This package, which is used in the example scripts "ar1.R", "ar3.R", "resex.R", "identAR2.R", "identMA1.R" and "MA1-AO.R", is currently archived by CRAN due to a small problem in one of packageâ€™s supporting functions.  We anticipate having the package back on CRAN in 2024. Meanwhile, the package is available at the repository https://github.com/spkaluzny/robustarima of package maintainer Stephen Kaluzny.  To install robustarima, you need to have first installed the package devtools.  Then you can install the utility packages splusTimeDate and  splusTimeSeries, and robustarima with:
```
> devtools::install_github("spkaluzny/splusTimeDate")
> devtools::install_github("spkaluzny/splusTimeSeries")
> devtools::install_github("spkaluzny/robustarima")
```

# Version 1.0.8

- Argument "length" of seq() fixed to "length.out"
- Fixed Rprintf() and REprintf() bad arguments in lmrob.c

# Version 1.0.7

- The opt and mopt loss functions, known as rho functions, specified by the choice family = "opt" or family = "mopt" in the function lmrobdet.control are now calculated using polynomials, rather than using the standard normal error function (erf) as in versions of RobStatTM prior to 1.0.7.  The numerical results one now gets with the opt or mopt choices will differ by small amounts from those in earlier package versions. Users who wish to replicate results from releases prior to 1.0.7 may do so by using the family arguments family = "optV0" or family = "moptV0".   Note that the derivative of the rho loss function, known as the "psi" function, is still an analytic function. For further details, see the Vignette "polynomialRhoFunctions".

# Version 1.0.6

- locScaleM produces a warning and returns 0 for the estimated scale when more 
than half of the input values are equal to each other. 

# Version 1.0.5

- Replace legacy S-compatibility deprecated macros DOUBLE_* in 
R_ext/Constants.h (included by R.h) by the standard C99 constants

# Version 1.0.4

- For the function `lmrobdetMM.RFPE`, when the argument `bothVals` is set 
to `TRUE`, the names of the first element in the returned list has been
changed to `minRhoMM.C` (from `minRhoMM`).

# Version 1.0.3 (November 2021)

- The Shiny User Interface capability has been removed, and correspondingly the
Shiny Interface to RobStatTM Vignette has also been removed. The reason for 
doing so is that the Shiny capability resulted in too many package dependencies. 
We anticipate that Greg Brownson (gregory.brownson@gmail.com), the creator of 
the RobSTatTM Shiny UI, will 
make  that capability available in an independent package complement to RobStatTM. 

- The package fit.models has been removed as a dependency, i.e., it is no 
longer listed as Depends. The reason for this is that including fit.models in 
RobStatTM created too many dependencies.  The fit.model package stand-alone 
functionality works very well with RobStatTM.  Correspondingly, the use of 
fit.models has been removed from the "Vignette for Command Line Use of 
RobStatTM.pdf" document, and is now provided in the separate 
vignette  "fit.models using RobStatTM.pdf".

- In `src/lmrob.c` add USE_FC_LEN_T and use FCONE when calling BLAS and 
LAPACK Fortran functions  (https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-devel/R-exts.html#Fortran-character-strings)

- Re-ordered the elements in the object returned by `covRob` and `Multirobu`, renamed the 
argument `cor` to `corr`, and now the correlation matrix (if the argument 
`corr = TRUE`) is returned in the element `cor`.

- Renamed the returned entry `weights` to `wts` and the order of other entries
in the object returned by `covClassic`

- Removed comment on the help page of `lmrobdetMM.RFPE` referring to it being for internal use. 
This was not correct. The function can be used directly.

- `lmrobdetMM.RFPE` now includes the argument `bothVals`. If set to `TRUE` the 
function returns a list with the two terms (named `minRhoMM` and `penaltyRFPE`)
that added together equal the RFPE (see equation (5.39) in Section
5.6.2 of the book "Robust Statistics: Theory and Methods (with R)". 
If `bothVals` is `FALSE` then the function returns a scalar with the RPFE value. 

- Objects returned by `covClassic` and `covRob` now include an element `call` with 
an image of the call that produced the object with all the arguments named (the 
matched call).

- The function `lmrobLinTest` has been renamed to `lmrobdetLinTest`

- Fixed a bug producing undesired behavior when an exact fit (more than half of the 
data lying perfectly on a line) was detected. 

- The help page for lmrobdetMM was revised to describe all entries in the 
returned object. 


# Version 1.0.1:
- Fix an issue with exact fits if the M-scale estimate is (close to) 0.
- Includes help pages for all datasets.
