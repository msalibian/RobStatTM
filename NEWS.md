# Version 1.0.4

- For the function `lmrobdetMM.RFPE`, when the argument `bothVals` is set 
to `TRUE`, the names of the first element in the returned list has been
changed to `minRhoMM.C` (from `minRhoMM`).

# Version 1.0.3 (November 2021)

- The Shiny User Interface capability has been removed, and correspondingly the
Shiny Interface to RobStatTM Vignette has also been removed. The reason for 
doing so is that the Shiny capability resulted in too many package dependencies. 
We anticipate that Greg Brownson (gregory.brownson@gmail.com), the creator of 
the RobSTatTM Shiny UI, will 
make  that capability available in an independent package complement to RobStatTM. 

- The package fit.models has been removed as a dependency, i.e., it is no 
longer listed as Depends. The reason for this is that including fit.models in 
RobStatTM created too many dependencies.  The fit.model package stand-alone 
functionality works very well with RobStatTM.  Correspondingly, the use of 
fit.models has been removed from the "Vignette for Command Line Use of 
RobStatTM.pdf" document, and is now provided in the separate 
vignette  "fit.models using RobStatTM.pdf".

- In `src/lmrob.c` add USE_FC_LEN_T and use FCONE when calling BLAS and 
LAPACK Fortran functions  (https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-devel/R-exts.html#Fortran-character-strings)

- Re-ordered the elements in the object returned by `covRob` and `Multirobu`, renamed the 
argument `cor` to `corr`, and now the correlation matrix (if the argument 
`corr = TRUE`) is returned in the element `cor`.

- Renamed the returned entry `weights` to `wts` and the order of other entries
in the object returned by `covClassic`

- Removed comment on the help page of `lmrobdetMM.RFPE` referring to it being for internal use. 
This was not correct. The function can be used directly.

- `lmrobdetMM.RFPE` now includes the argument `bothVals`. If set to `TRUE` the 
function returns a list with the two terms (named `minRhoMM` and `penaltyRFPE`)
that added together equal the RFPE (see equation (5.39) in Section
5.6.2 of the book "Robust Statistics: Theory and Methods (with R)". 
If `bothVals` is `FALSE` then the function returns a scalar with the RPFE value. 

- Objects returned by `covClassic` and `covRob` now include an element `call` with 
an image of the call that produced the object with all the arguments named (the 
matched call).

- The function `lmrobLinTest` has been renamed to `lmrobdetLinTest`

- Fixed a bug producing undesired behavior when an exact fit (more than half of the 
data lying perfectly on a line) was detected. 

- The help page for lmrobdetMM was revised to describe all entries in the 
returned object. 


# Version 1.0.1:
- Fix an issue with exact fits if the M-scale estimate is (close to) 0.
- Includes help pages for all datasets.
