\title{Robust R^2 coefficient of determination}
\usage{
INVTR2(RR2, family, cc)
}
\arguments{
\item{RR2}{the proportional difference in loss functions (a naive robust R^2 coefficient).}

\item{family}{family string specifying the name of the family of loss function to be used (current valid
options are "bisquare", "optimal" and "modopt").}

\item{cc}{tuning parameters to be computed according to efficiency and / or breakdown
considerations. See \link{lmrobdet.control}, \link{bisquare}, \link{modopt}
and \link{optimal}.}
}
\value{
An unbiased version of the robust R^2 coefficient of determination.
}
\description{
This function computes a robust version of the R^2 coefficient of determination.
It is used internally by \code{\link{lmrobdetMM}}, 
and not meant to be used directly.
