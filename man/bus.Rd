\description{
This data set corresponds to a study in automatic vehicle recognition.
Each of the 218 rows corresponds to a view of a bus silhouette, and contains
18 attributes of the image. It was decided to exclude variable 9 and divide the
remaining variables by their MADNâ€™s.
}
\details{
Description: The following features were extracted from the silhouettes.
1. compactness
2. circularity
3. distance circularity
4. radius ratio
5. principal axis aspect ratio
6. maximum length aspect ratio
7. scatter ratio
8. elongatedness
9. principal axis rectangularity
10. maximum length rectangularity
11. scaled variance along major axis
12. scaled variance along minor axis
13. scaled radius of gyration
14. skewness about major axis
15. skewness about minor axis
16. kurtosis about minor axis
17. kurtosis about major axis
