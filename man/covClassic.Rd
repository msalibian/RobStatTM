\usage{
covClassic(
  data,
  corr = FALSE,
  center = TRUE,
  distance = TRUE,
  na.action = na.fail,
  unbiased = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{a numeric matrix or data frame containing the data.}

\item{corr}{a logical flag.  If \code{corr = TRUE} then the estimated correlation matrix is computed.}

\item{center}{a logical flag or a numeric vector of length \code{p} (where \code{p} is the number of columns of \code{x}) specifying the center.  If \code{center = TRUE} then the center is estimated.  Otherwise the center is taken to be 0.}

\item{distance}{a logical flag.  If \code{distance = TRUE} the Mahalanobis distances are computed.}

\item{na.action}{a function to filter missing data.  The default \code{na.fail} produces an error if missing values are present.  An alternative is \code{na.omit} which deletes observations that contain one or more missing values.}

\item{unbiased}{a logical flag. If \code{TRUE} the unbiased estimator is returned (computed with denominator equal to \code{n-1}), else the MLE (computed with denominator equal to \code{n}) is returned.}
}
\value{
a list with class \dQuote{covClassic} containing the following elements:
\item{center}{a numeric vector containing the estimate of the location vector.}
\item{cov}{a numeric matrix containing the estimate of the covariance matrix.}
\item{cor}{a numeric matrix containing the estimate of the correlation matrix if the argument \code{corr = TRUE}. Otherwise it is set to \code{NULL}.}
\item{dist}{a numeric vector containing the squared Mahalanobis distances. Only present if \code{distance = TRUE} in the \code{call}.}
\item{call}{an image of the call that produced the object with all the arguments named.}
}
\description{
Compute an estimate of the covariance/correlation matrix and location
vector using classical methods.
}
\details{
Its main intention is to return an object compatible to that
produced by \code{\link{covRob}}, but fit using classical methods.
}
\note{
Originally, and in S-PLUS, this function was called \code{cov}; it has
been renamed, as that did mask the function in the standard package \pkg{stats}.
